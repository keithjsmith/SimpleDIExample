Create new project MVC5AndUnity

Copy TwoTierMVCReview.DAL folder into the MVC5AndUnity folder
Add existing project, reference to DAL and move connection
	string from  DAL app.config to MVC5AndUnity web.config

Install Unity.MVC NuGet package to MVC5AndUnity project

Look at UnityConfig, we manually performed these steps in
	the Program.cs of our CSharpAndUnity project

Look at UnityMvcActivator, discuss Dispose method

Discuss need for a parent Generic Repository and how making
	an interface will help with abstraction
Create IGenericRepository parent class
Create Generic Repository that implements the IGenericRepository
	add field and ctor first
	Update the various methods behaviors
	Update the Dispose method and comments

Create specific WGProductRepository class

Build WGProduct Controller with views
Delete the Create, Delete, and Edit views
	We won't be building those
Update the Index View to have no links to create, edit, delete

Version 1:
Add _repo field and ctor insantiating it with WGProductRepository instance
Update Dispose method
Update Index Action
Update Details Action

This should run at this time.

Version 2:
Convert the WGproductsController Index action to use the IWGProductRepository
	instead of WGProductRepository
Code won't run now!

Go to UnityConfig.cs and add RegisterType
Code runs again!

Add InStockWGproductRepository with comments and mappings
	back using connectedsql
Change the UnityConfig Registration to use the new Repository
	for dependency injection
